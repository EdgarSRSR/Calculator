## Assignment

Create a Calculator </br>
Create functions for: </br>
1. add</br>
2. substract</br>
3. multiply</br>
4. divide</br>

Create a new function operate that takes an operator and 2 numbers and calls one of the functions mentioned above</br>

Create a calculator with HTML, buttons for each digit and for "equals", a "clear" button and a display for the calculator</br>

When you click buttons on the calculator the "display value" should be stored in a variable</br>

The number recorded on when the user presses a button should be stored, and save which operation has been chosen anf then activate operate() when "=" is pressed</br>

Once operate() is pressed, update the display with the solution.</br>

To do this, it is needed to figure out hot to store all the values and call the operate function with them. THIS IS HARD TO FIGURE OUT</br>

Round answers with long decimals</br>

Display a message error if the user tried to divide by zero </br>

Pressing "=" before entering all of the numbers or an operator could cause problems</br>

Add "." button so that the user can use floating numbers</br>

Add a "backspace" button to correct the input numbers</br>
